We then uses these values to produce a unique 3D/VR representation of the dream&mdash;lovingly called a dream ‘sprite’. These sprites give users a creative, visual way to explore the underlying emotions behind their dreams.\n          <br /><br />\n          The app also provides a personalized dashboard of sleep statistics.
